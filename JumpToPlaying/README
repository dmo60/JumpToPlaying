JumpToPlaying
===============

JumpToPlaying is a Rhythmbox plugin which adds a context menu entry and a toolbar button to jump to the playing song.

It is also possible to set a custom label for the toolbar icon (e.g. when the default text is too long) in the plugin's configuration dialog.



Installation
===============

	1) Run the 'install.sh' script.
	
	2) Enable the plugin in Rhythmbox under 'Edit > Plugins'
